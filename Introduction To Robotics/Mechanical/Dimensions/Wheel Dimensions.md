# Impact of Wheel Size on Robot Performance

---

## **1. Balanced Speed and Control**
- **Why:**  
  The wheel size directly affects the robot's **linear speed** (\(v=r⋅ω\)). A **6 cm wheel** provides moderate speed at typical motor speeds (60–100 RPM), ideal for cleaning.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Covers large areas efficiently without moving too fast.  
  - Maintains precise movement for effective debris collection.

## **2. Sufficient Torque for Mobility**
- **Why:**  
  Torque (\( T=F⋅r \)) determines the force needed to move the robot. Smaller wheels increase torque demand, while larger wheels reduce it. A **6 cm wheel** offers the right balance.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Motors operate efficiently with minimal strain (~1 Nm torque).  
  - Handles small obstacles (1–2 cm) and transitions between surfaces reliably.

## **3. Optimal Obstacle Clearance**
- **Why:**  
  A 6 cm wheel gives a ground clearance of **3 cm** (wheel radius), allowing the robot to navigate small obstacles like rugs and thresholds.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Climbs over standard household barriers.  
  - Maintains stability while avoiding excessive height.

---

## **4. Compact Design**
- **Why:**  
  Larger wheels take up more space inside the robot, limiting space for other components (e.g., battery, dustbin). A 6 cm wheel fits well within a compact chassis.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Leaves room for larger batteries and functional components.  
  - Maintains a lightweight, efficient design.

---

## **5. Enhanced Stability**
- **Why:**  
  Stability is critical for smooth navigation. Larger wheels raise the center of gravity, while smaller wheels may get stuck. A 6 cm wheel provides a **low center of gravity** without sacrificing performance.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Ensures smooth turns and obstacle handling.  
  - Reduces the chance of getting stuck on debris or uneven surfaces.
