# Components and Connections:

1. **Power Supply:**
   - Provides energy to the **Controller**, which distributes control signals to all components.

---

2. **Controller:**
   - The brain of the system.
   - Receives input signals from **Proximity Sensors** for detecting obstacles or collisions.
   - Sends control signals to **Drivers** to manage motor operation.

---

3. **Proximity Sensors:**
   - Provide real-time feedback to the **Controller** to adapt motion and avoid obstacles.

---

4. **Drivers:**
   - Act as intermediaries that amplify or translate signals from the **Controller** to the motors.
   - Distributes signals to:
     - **Servo Motor M1**
     - **Servo Motor M2**
     - **Vacuum Motor**

---

5. **Motors:**
   - **Servo Motors M1 and M2:** Control the **mobility** (wheels) of the robot.
   - **Vacuum Motor:** Drives the suction system for cleaning.
