## 1. **Why Rubber-Coated Plastic?**

### **Traction and Grip**
- **Rubber Layer:**  
  - Provides excellent grip on smooth and slippery surfaces like tiles and hardwood floors.
- **Impact:**  
  - Prevents slipping, ensuring smooth navigation and better handling of inclines or uneven surfaces.

### **Durability**
- **Plastic Core:**  
  - Made of rigid ABS or polycarbonate, ensuring structural strength and resistance to deformation under load.
- **Impact:**  
  - Durable enough for long-term use without significant wear.

### **Noise Reduction**
- **Rubber Outer Layer:**  
  - Softens contact with the floor, reducing noise compared to hard materials like plain plastic or metal.
- **Impact:**  
  - Makes the robot quieter, ideal for home use without disturbing occupants.

### **Surface Compatibility**
- Rubber-coated wheels adapt to multiple surface types:
  - **Hardwood:** Provides grip without scratching the floor.
  - **Tiles:** Maintains traction even on smooth or slippery surfaces.
  - **Carpets:** Offers sufficient friction for smooth navigation.

### **Shock Absorption**
- **Rubber Flexibility:**  
  - Absorbs small impacts or vibrations caused by uneven surfaces.
- **Impact:**  
  - Improves the robotâ€™s stability and reduces wear on components like the suspension.

## 2. **Alternative Materials (and Why They Are Less Ideal)**

| **Material**        | **Advantages**                           | **Disadvantages**                                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plain Plastic**    | Durable, lightweight, and low cost       | Poor grip on smooth surfaces; noisy operation.         |
| **Metal (e.g., Aluminum)** | Extremely durable; good for rugged applications | Heavy, noisy, and overkill for indoor surfaces.        |
| **Silicone**         | Excellent grip and quiet operation       | Less durable; prone to tearing under high friction.    |
| **Foam Rubber**      | Soft, lightweight, and provides great traction | Low durability; not ideal for long-term use.          |

## 3. **Conclusion**
The ideal wheel material for a vacuum robot is **Rubber-Coated Plastic** because it provides:
- **Excellent traction** on multiple surfaces.
- **Noise reduction** for quiet operation.
- **Durability** to handle long-term use.

This combination ensures **optimal performance**, **adaptability**, and **user satisfaction** in a household environment.
