# Mathematical Model in the Code

The mathematical model of the robot is based on the principles of **path planning**, **navigation**, and **kinematics**, as outlined in **Chapters 5 and 6**. Below is an explanation of the key components:

---

## **1. Path Planning**
Path planning ensures the robot can efficiently navigate the environment while avoiding obstacles. 

---

## **2. Navigation**
The robot's navigation is based on kinematic equations that update its position over time.

---

## **3. Kinematics**
The robot's motion is calculated using velocity, orientation, and time step to determine its position.

---

This model serves as the foundation for the robot's ability to clean, navigate, and avoid obstacles in its environment.
