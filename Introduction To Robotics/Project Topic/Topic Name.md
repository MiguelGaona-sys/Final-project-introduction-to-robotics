Topic: Autonomous House-Cleaning Robot 
Description: This project involves designing and simulating an autonomous robot capable of navigating and cleaning an indoor environment. Using map-based path-planning algorithms, the robot systematically covers the area and avoid obstacles. The project includes mathematical modeling for the house-cleaning robot focusing on reactive navigation and map-based planning approaches. This work is implemented and simulated in MATLAB, with a CAD model representing the physical design of the robot.
