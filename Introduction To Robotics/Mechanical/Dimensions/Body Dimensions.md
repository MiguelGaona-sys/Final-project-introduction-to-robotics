# **Why 27 cm Diameter and 8.45 cm Height Are Ideal for a Vacuum Robot**

---

## **1. Optimal Dimensions for Home Cleaning**
The robot's dimensions—**27 cm diameter** and **8.45 cm total height**—are specifically designed to balance compactness, accessibility, and performance for household cleaning applications.

## **2. Diameter: 27 cm**
- **Why This Diameter is Ideal:**  
  The 27 cm diameter ensures efficient cleaning coverage while maintaining compact maneuverability.  

### **Advantages:**  
- **Cleaning Coverage:**  
  - A wider cleaning path per pass reduces the overall cleaning time.  
- **Maneuverability:**  
  - Compact enough to navigate tight spaces, such as between furniture legs and narrow hallways.  
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Fits comfortably through standard household spaces without collisions.  
- **Aesthetic Balance:**  
  - Provides a sleek, low-profile design without appearing bulky.

## **3. Height: 8.45 cm**
The total height of **8.45 cm** is the result of:  
- **Top Casing:** 5.3 cm  
- **Middle Segment:** 2.2 cm  
- **Ground Clearance:** 0.95 cm  

### **Why This Height is Ideal:**  
- **Furniture Clearance:**  
  - Most furniture has a clearance of **8–10 cm**. At 8.45 cm, the robot easily cleans under sofas, beds, and coffee tables.  
- **Internal Component Space:**  
  - Accommodates essential components:  
    - **Suction Motor** (30–50W) for debris collection.  
    - **Battery Pack** (3000–5000 mAh) for extended runtime.  
    - **Brush System** for efficient sweeping and cleaning.  
- **Ground Clearance:**  
  - A **0.95 cm clearance** allows the robot to navigate small obstacles like rugs, cords, and thresholds while maintaining stability.  
- **Stability:**  
  - Keeps the center of gravity low, preventing tipping or instability during movement and turns.

## **4. Balance Between Compactness and Performance**
The combination of **27 cm diameter** and **8.45 cm height** provides a perfect balance of:  
1. **Efficiency:** Covers large areas with each cleaning pass.  
2. **Accessibility:** Reaches under low-clearance furniture where dust often accumulates.  
3. **Stability:** Navigates smoothly over uneven surfaces while remaining stable.  
4. **Component Space:** Houses all critical systems (motors, batteries, and dustbin) without crowding.  
5. **Aesthetic Design:** Compact and sleek, blending seamlessly into home environments.
