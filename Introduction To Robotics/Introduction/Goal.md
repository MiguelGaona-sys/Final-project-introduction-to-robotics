## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to design and simulate an **autonomous house-cleaning robot** capable of:

- **Systematically navigating and cleaning indoor environments**
- **Integrating map-based path planning for optimal coverage**
- **Employing dynamic obstacle avoidance to adapt to changing surroundings**

This project emphasizes the intersection of **robotics**, **mathematical modeling**, and **simulation**, serving as a foundation for future advancements in **autonomous systems** and **intelligent home automation**.
