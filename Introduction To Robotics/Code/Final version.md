# Key Improvements Over the Previous Version

---

## **1. Systematic Zigzag Path Planning**
- **Initial Version:**  
  Relied on random direction changes and reactive behaviors for obstacle avoidance, resulting in inefficient and repetitive coverage.  
- **Final Version:**  
  Implements **horizontal and vertical zigzag patterns**, ensuring systematic and complete area coverage. The robot alternates between horizontal and vertical patterns dynamically to avoid any missed areas.

---

## **2. Condition-Based Path Switching**
- **Initial Version:**  
  No distinction in behavior based on robot location.  
- **Final Version:**  
  Introduces a **condition-based trigger**:  
  - Switches to **vertical zigzag navigation** when the robot enters a specific region (**x < 10 and y > 23**), adapting to the map's geometry for optimal coverage.  
  - Automatically alternates patterns when hitting walls or boundaries to avoid unnecessary looping.

---

## **3. Predefined Map with Static Walls**
- **Initial Version:**  
  Obstacles were randomly scattered, making systematic path planning challenging.  
- **Final Version:**  
  Uses a fixed **binary occupancy grid** representing walls and room boundaries. The robot follows this predefined map for **collision detection** and **planning**.

---

## **4. Complete Area Coverage**
- **Initial Version:**  
  The robot's random movements often left areas uncleaned.  
- **Final Version:**  
  Tracks cleaned areas in real time using a **coverage map**.  
  - Ensures the robot cleans the **entire accessible area** (**coverageThreshold = 1.0**) before stopping.

---

## **5. Improved Robot Kinematics**
- **Initial Version:**  
  Basic position updates without realistic motion dynamics.  
- **Final Version:**  
  Utilizes **differential drive kinematics**:  
  - Updates robot pose \((x, y, Î¸)\) using **linear velocity** and **heading angle**.  
  - Prevents wall crossing through accurate **collision detection** and **inflation of obstacles** to account for the robot's radius.
## MATLAB Code
Below is the MATLAB code implementing the enhanced functionality:

```matlab
% Simulation Parameters
mapSize = [25, 25]; % Room dimensions in meters
resolution = 5; % Resolution (cells per meter)
robotRadius = 0.5; % Radius of the robot in meters

% Create a binary occupancy map
roomMap = binaryOccupancyMap(mapSize(1), mapSize(2), resolution);

% Define walls (previously used map layout)
% Outer boundaries
setOccupancy(roomMap, [0:0.1:25; repmat(0, 1, numel(0:0.1:25))]', 1); % Bottom wall
setOccupancy(roomMap, [0:0.1:25; repmat(25, 1, numel(0:0.1:25))]', 1); % Top wall
setOccupancy(roomMap, [repmat(0, 1, numel(0:0.1:25)); 0:0.1:25]', 1); % Left wall
setOccupancy(roomMap, [repmat(25, 1, numel(0:0.1:25)); 0:0.1:25]', 1); % Right wall

% Vertical walls to divide the space
setOccupancy(roomMap, [repmat(12, 1, numel(0:0.1:15)); 0:0.1:15]', 1); % Middle vertical wall
setOccupancy(roomMap, [repmat(20, 1, numel(10:0.1:25)); 10:0.1:25]', 1); % Rightmost vertical wall

% Inflate the map for the robot's radius
inflate(roomMap, robotRadius);

% Define a coverage map
coverageMap = zeros(mapSize * resolution); % 0 = uncleaned, 1 = cleaned

% Robot Parameters
robotPose = [21, 24, 0]; % [x, y, theta] - Starting position near the top left
linearSpeed = 0.8; % Linear speed
sampleTime = 0.1; % Time step

% Simulation Parameters
maxIterations = 5000; % Maximum iterations for cleaning
coverageThreshold = 1.0; % Ensure 100% of accessible area is covered
