# Autonomous House-Cleaning Robot

## Description
This project involves designing and simulating an **autonomous robot** capable of navigating and cleaning an indoor environment. Using **map-based path-planning algorithms**, the robot systematically covers the area while avoiding obstacles.

### Key Features:
- **Systematic Cleaning:** Ensures efficient coverage of the indoor environment.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Reacts dynamically to navigate around objects.
- **Map-Based Planning:** Utilizes advanced algorithms for optimal path planning.

### Technical Aspects:
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Focuses on reactive navigation and map-based planning approaches.
- **Implementation:** Developed and simulated in **MATLAB**.
- **Physical Design:** Includes a **CAD model** representing the robot's physical structure.
